bamlanivimab and etesevimab,Covid 19,,"Possible side effects of bamlanivimab and etesevimab include: Allergic reactions. Allergic reactions can happen during and after infusion with bamlanivimab and etesevimab. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you get any of the following signs and symptoms of allergic reactions: fever, chills, nausea, headache, shortness of breath, low or high blood pressure, rapid or slow heart rate, chest discomfort or pain, weakness, confusion, feeling tired, wheezing, swelling of your lips, face, or throat, rash including hives, itching, muscle aches, dizziness, and sweating. These reactions may be severe or life threatening. Worsening symptoms after treatment: You may experience new or worsening symptoms after infusion, including fever, difficulty breathing, rapid or slow heart rate, tiredness, weakness or confusion. If these occur, contact your healthcare provider or seek immediate medical attention as some of these events have required hospitalization. It is unknown if these events are related to treatment or are due to the progression of COVID-19. The side effects of getting any medicine by vein may include brief pain, bleeding, bruising of the skin, soreness, swelling, and possible infection at the infusion site. These are not all the possible side effects of bamlanivimab and etesevimab. Not a lot of people have been given bamlanivimab and etesevimab. Serious and unexpected side effects may happen. Bamlanivimab and etesevimab are still being studied so it is possible that all of the risks are not known at this time. It is possible that bamlanivimab and etesevimab could interfere with your body's own ability to fight off a future infection of SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, bamlanivimab and etesevimab may reduce your body's immune response to a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. Specific studies have not been conducted to address these possible risks. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have any questions. What other treatment choices are there? Like bamlanivimab and etesevimab, FDA may allow for the emergency use of other medicines to treat people with COVID-19. Go to https://www.drugs.com/condition/covid-19.html for information on medicines available to treat people with COVID-19. Your healthcare provider may talk with you about clinical trials you may be eligible for. It is your choice to be treated or not to be treated with bamlanivimab and etesevimab. Should you decide not to receive bamlanivimab and etesevimab or stop it at any time, it will not change your standard medical care. Pregnancy or Breastfeeding There is limited experience treating pregnant women or breastfeeding mothers with bamlanivimab and etesevimab. For a mother and unborn baby, the benefit of receiving bamlanivimab and etesevimab may be greater than the risk from the treatment. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, discuss your options and specific situation with your healthcare provider. How do I report side effects with bamlanivimab and etesevimab? Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any side effect that bothers you or does not go away. Report side effects to FDA MedWatch at www.fda.gov/medwatch, call 1-800-FDA-1088, or contact Eli Lilly and Company on +1-855-545-5921.

Follow your doctor’s dosage recommendations closely. The following medicines can make zopiclone less effective: Some medicines for epilepsy such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin Rifampicin (an antibiotic) - for infections St John’s Wort (a herbal medicine) - for mood swings and depression This medication can change the levels of liver enzymes shown up in blood tests. This can mean that your liver is not working properly. If you are going to have a blood test, it is important to tell your doctor that you are taking zopiclone. Pregnancy and breastfeeding Zopiclone is not recommended during pregnancy. If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Taking zopiclone during pregnancy may affect your baby. Some studies have shown that there may be an increased risk of cleft lip and palate (sometimes called “harelip”) in the newborn baby. Reduced fetal movement and fetal heart rate variability may occur after taking zopiclone during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. If zopiclone is taken at the end of pregnancy or during labour, your baby may show muscle weakness, a drop in body temperature, difficulty feeding and breathing problems (respiratory depression). If this medicine is taken regularly in late pregnancy, your baby may develop physical dependence and may be at risk of developing withdrawal symptoms such as agitation or shaking. In this case the newborn should be closely monitored during the postnatal period. Do not take zopiclone if you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Small amounts of this medication may pass into breast milk. If you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking any medicine.
